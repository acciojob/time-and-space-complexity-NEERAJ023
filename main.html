	<h1> Time Complexity is time taken by the code during run space Complexity is space occupied by the code </h1>
	<p>The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis.time is very efficient for any code</p>
	<p>if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space, then Auxiliary Space would be a better criterion than <B>Space Complexity</B>. Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, Insertion sort, and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space. The space complexity of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though. However, just because you have n calls total doesnâ€™t mean it takes O(n) space.</p>
